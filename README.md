# -MoneyMentor-GDG-Solution-Track-2025-
This is our (team name T.A.S) submission for GDG Solution Track 2025. 
Our problem statement is: GenAI-Powered Financial Assistant for Better Investing Decisions.

This is an mvp not a complete prototype. We have the idea of it's potential and future prospects. 
The overview functionalities include:
  1) Feed and community sections. Upon expanding our user base, these features can be made functional. For now these are for concept show.
  2) The roadmap section will be made functional when we have a large database and suffiecient backend which will track the user progress and update the roadmap, hence making the platform more personalized.
  3) The simulation section will be a complete investment based progress tracker in a gamified version. Similar to second-life but just for investment decisions.
  4) The paper trading works fine, we need a databse to store the user data so that the portfolio does not resets itself. And on further development, more stocks and better realtime market simulation will be available.
  5) Last but not the least, the AI chat powered by Gemini API. The model is instructed to give ivestment tips and teach about economics and finaces based on your prompts and mentioned risk tolerance. Further enhancements can include realtime market analysis and investment sugestions.
